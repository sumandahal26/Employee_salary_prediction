# Employee Salary Prediction

## Overview

This project predicts **employee salaries** using machine learning based on factors like experience, education, job role, and other relevant features.
It was developed as part of my **internship**, focusing on practical data preprocessing and model building.

---

## Objective

To build a regression model that can estimate employee salaries from historical data and help understand which factors influence salary the most.

---

## What I Did

* Cleaned and preprocessed raw salary data
* Performed basic data analysis to find patterns
* Trained multiple regression models
* Compared model performance and selected the best one

---

## Tech Used

* Python
* Pandas, NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib

---

## Project Flow

1. Data collection
2. Data preprocessing
3. Model training
4. Model evaluation

---

## Outcome

The final model predicts salaries with reasonable accuracy.
Experience and job-related features showed the highest impact on salary prediction.
